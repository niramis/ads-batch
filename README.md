Spring-boot app

Processes csv file as batch and stores data in H2 database

Includes Swagger doc for rest api 

### Possible improvements:
- large csv should be processed via multithreading
- In larger project should be used some conventions for file naming and packaging - for example package stats may be renamed as DTO - for storing data transfer objects
